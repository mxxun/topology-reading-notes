# 1.2.10: Metric topology II

1. Subspace topologies are harmonious w/ metric; if we restrict the metric to the subspace, it gives the subspace topology. yeah makes sense, all balls are the same and cut the same way.
1. Nothing about orders.
1. All metrics have hausdorff axiom; two points can have disjoint balls that are smaller than half the distance between them.
1. countable products of metric spaces are metrizable! as an exercise.

1. continuous functions!
    1. first, epsilon-delta formalism of continuity works in arbitrary metrized space.
    1. second, one can build continuous functions through +, –, ×, ÷ of functions X -> \R
        1. categorically!
        1. Aka: +, –, × are continuous functions R×R->R, and ÷ : R×(R–{0}) -> R
        1. and then by composition.
    1. second part 2, one can take limits of "uniformly convergent sequences of continuous functions"; I think this means that if you take an \N-sized bundle of functions X -> \R, you can join them into a function X -> \R^\omega (naturally), and then also do...what? have a standard continuous \R^\omega -> \R that takes limits? hum.
1. ....sigh, I find all of that intensely boring; _fucK_ analysis, I wanna do topology
