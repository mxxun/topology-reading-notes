# 1.2.10: Metric topology II

1. Note: subspaces of metric spaces are metrized by the restriction of metric
2. Order topologies: some metrizable, some not
3. All metric spaces are Haudorff....pretty obviously I think? we can just take sufficiently small balls to be disjoint.
4. Countable products of metrics are metric! Cool.

1. Continuous functions tho.
2. First idea: we now that continuity as openness of preimages is the same as epsilon-delta for \R, but this has analogues in arbitrary metrics; also, there's continuity as convergent sequences of xs and f(xs), and this also extends to metrics
3. Then, there will be some new methods for building continuous functions: +, -, *, / of continuous functions to R
    1. and also the more magical "limits of uniformly convergent sequences of continuous functions"
