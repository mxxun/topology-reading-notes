# 1.2.7: Continuous functions

[toc]
$$\gdef \ra \rightarrow$$

### Definition, continuity on basis
1. Okay, so, again, $f: U \ra V$ is continuous if preimage of any open set is open

2. Lemma: if $f : U \ra V$ is continuous on basis B of V, then it's contiuous everywhere
    1. Well, we factor any open set of V into the union of basis, we take preimage of all that, we union these back, and we get an open preimage, voila
2. Lemma: same shit for prebases
    1. well, we factor any open set into union of finite intersections of prebases, & then etc

### Equivalence to epsilon-delta
2. Lemma: $f : \R \ra \R$ is $\epsilon\text-\delta$ continuous iff its hereby continuous
    1. Let's come back to this & start from an actual epsilon-delta definition of continuity if we forgot it
    2. Definition: function is epsilon-delta continuous at a point if in a delta-neighbourhood of that point its values are in epsilon-neighbourhood of the value at the point
        1. the important part is that delta is function of epsilon; however thin we want to bind function values, we can find a neighbourhood in which such a bound holds
    3. And our continuity is: function is continuous if preimage of any open set is again open
    4. Hmm.
    5. If we took an epsilon-delta continuous:
        1. Let's pick some basis (a, b) (in the image)
        2. Union over points y of it; union over preimage points x of y; the thing to union is a delta-interval around x corresponding to some epsilon-interval around y contained in (a, b)
        3. This gets us a set that is: open as a union of opens, covering all points in the preimage of (a,b), w/ image entirely contained in (a,b)
        4. Two latter force it to both contain and be contained, and therefore equal, to the preimage of (a,b)
        5. & so preimage of (a,b) is open; done
    4. If we took our-continuous:
        1. We need to take an arbitrary epsilon-interval around an image point f(x) and show that there's a delta-interval around the relevant preimage point x whose image is entirely contained in that epsilon-interval
        2. We do it like so: we take preimage of that epsilon-interval, we observe it to be open and covering the preimage point x, we take some strictcover of that open set by basis intervals, we take an interval that contains x, we pick a _smaller_ delta-interval around x, we project it back, it is contained.

### Properties equivalent to continuity
3. Theorem 18.1: properties equivalent to continuity
    1. Have: cont <-> 2nd, cont <-> 3rd, cont -> 1st -> 2nd
    1. f(Cl A) $\subset$ Cl f A for any subset A: have continuity -> this
        1. A rephrasal: any boundary point of A is projected inside Cl f A
        2. if there's an x that's instead projected into Co Cl f A and f is continuous, then f^-1 (Co Cl f A) constitutes a neighbourhood of x disjoint from A (because A is projected into Cl f A entirely), which shouldn't happen to limit points.
        3. From here to closed-cont (below): take a preimage U of closed set V. Cl U cannot add any new elements because $f(\overbar U) \subset \overbar f(U) = f(U)$ Therefore, U is closed. done.
    2. preimages of closed are closed: have both ways
        1. the relevant observation is that f^-1(B) and F^-1(Co B) are complements: any point of X is projected into one xor another.
        2. Then you have a line of reasoning like: B closed <-> Co B open -(cont)> f^-1 Co B open <-> Co f^-1 Co B = f^-1 B is closed
        3. And the other way around: B open <-> Co B closed -> f^-1 Co B closed <-> f^-1 B open
    3. for any neighbourhood V of an image point f(x) you can find a neighbourhood U of the preimage point x whose image f(U) is contained in it (V): have both ways
        1. From continuity to this is trivial: you take preimage of V, it's open and contains x, done
        2. Conversely: take an open set V: Y; it's a neighbourhood to each of its elements f(x). union over its elements y; union over preimages x from f^-1(y); take the U that's f(U) \subset V
        3. we have an open preimage of V. Done.

### Homeomorphisms, embeddings
1. If f is bijective and continuous both ways, it's called homeomorphism. Yup.
    1. Oh! "f^-1 is continuous" is the same as "f sends open sets to open sets"
    2. that's _interesting_
3. Topological properties: if a property is expressed in terms of open (closed) sets of X, then any Y homeomorphic to X has the same properties as X. 
    1. Aka yep these are isomorphisms in the category Top of topological spaces

2. imbedding / embedding: if f is injective and continuous, then its restriction to its image is bijective wrt image-as-topspace, obv. It's not necessarily obvious that it's continuous the other way, but if it is, we'll call it _embedding_ (imbedding in the book's terminology)
3. Example: $\lambda (x:\R) . 3x+1$ is a homeomorphism
    1. invertible via $\lambda (y:\R) . (y-1)/3$, and both pretty obviously send open sets to open sets
2. Example: $\lambda (x : (-1, 1)) . {x \over 1 - x^2}$ is a homeomorphism between (-1, 1) and 0.
    1. inverse is computable via quadratic equation
    2. & it's not that hard to show that it's monotonous either way, and therefore middle points of an interval map into the interval between images of its boundaries, $a < c < b \Rightarrow f a < f c < f b$, and so $f (a, b) = (f a, f b)$.
3. Example: identity from R w/ lower limit to R is bijective but not continuous both ways
    1. (As seen before)
2. Example: Let's consider a unit circle w/ subspace topology inherited from R^2 and map [0, 1) (also w/ subspace from R) into it in the obvious way.
    1. A bijection: yep
    2. continuous from unit interval to the circle: preimages of intervals of circle w/o 0 obviously open; preimages of intervals containing 0 can be split into open [0, a) and (b, 1), so, yeah
    3. continuous from circle to the unit interval: preimage of [0, a) is not in fact open
4. (It occurs to me that given a topspace Y and set X and f : X -> Y, we can induce topology on X by assuming that f is continuous and making all preimages of open sets of Y open)
    1. (Doing this to circle and [0, 1) I think requires $[0, a) \cup (b, 1)$ to be open in addition to usual intervals, but not [0, a) themselves, and you can't finitely intersect these into [0, a); cool)

### How to build continuous functions
1. A constant function: mapping everything into a single point is continuous
    1. preimage of any open set containing it is full, not containing it is empty
    2. huh
    3. well, this is just a standard arrow to * embedded into the destination topspace
3. inclusion from subspace to supspace is continuous
    1. preimage of those not intersecting the subspace is empty; of those intersecting it is open by construction of open sets in the subset
2. composition
    1. pretty obvious honestly
2. restriction of domain to a subspace leaves function continuous
    1. ...as a composition of inclusion and the original, honestly
2. extending Y to a supspace preserves continuity
    1. again, by composition of original and inclusion
2. if $Z \subset Y$ contains f(X) then restricting f to X -> Z is also continuous
    1. I mean, any open set of Z is an intersection of a set open in Y w/ Z; given that f maps everything into Z, their preimages all stay the same and therefore are all open
    2. there's some subobject fuckery here
    3. Like, Z here is the smallest subobject of Y that can factor f through itself, what's this construction called? 
    4. Eh; maybe later
5. Local continuity: if X is a union (cover?) of open sets & f is continuous on every set in the union (taken as a subspace? pointwise?) then f is continuous on X
    1. Uh, take preimages of V in all $U_\alpha$ components of f; all of them are open in $U_\alpha$, and all open sets in $U_\alpha$ are in fact open in X by...construction, because they're intersections of open sets of X w/ open set $U_\alpha$ of X, right.
    2. THen you union these, and lo, preimage of V is open in X.
3. Pasting lemma: if we have $f: A \ra Y$ and $g: B \ra Y$ and they agree on $A \cap B$, and (condition on A and B in $A \cup B$), then pasting them together gives a continuous function $A \cup B \ra Y$.
    1. if A and B are open, then trivially via the previous lemma
    2. But them being closed should be enough:
    3. Think this is easier to do by "preimage of closed are closed"
    4. recall that closed sets of a subspace that's closed are closed in the supspace
    5. then if V is closed then f^-1(V) is closed in A and therefore in X, and likewise for g^-1(V), and then their union is closed in X, as desired
6. Example: $\begin{cases} x \mid x \le 0 \\ x/2 \mid x \ge 0 \end{cases}$ defines two functions on two closed subsets; these functions are in fact continuous and agree on the intersection {0}, and so the whole function is continuous
7. Maps into products!!!!!
    1. if f : A -> X × Y and f(a) = f_x(a), f_y(a), then f is continuous iff f_x and f_y are both continuous
    2. (This is a proof that X×Y is a categorical product wrt continuous arrows)
    3. From cont f to cont components: 
        1. define projection functions proj_{x,y} that map (x, y) to x and to y respectively.
        2. they're continuous: preimage of open V of X is the open V×Y and conversely.
        3. Then $f_x = proj_x \circ f$, and continuous by composition
    4. from cont components to cont f:
        1. Consider preimage of a basis set V×W, product of V open in X and W open in Y.
        2. in its preimage are points that are mapped into V by f_x _and also_ mapped into W by f_y; they're $f_x^{-1}(V) \cap f_y^{-1}(W)$
        3. which is open as an intersection of opens.
4. Coproducts are not defined nor touched upon, but we'll note here that maps from coproducts are continuous iff maps from their components are continuous
    1. ....well, actually these are pretty easy
    2. coproducts are disjoint unions w/ open sets of components used as a basis
        1. (can't have any more open sets: if some set A in a coproduct X+Y is open, but some its restricted-to-summand component $A \cap X$ is not open in X, then intersecting the set w/ summand (which is open in coproduct) gets an open set of coproduct whose preimage in that summand is not open)
    2. coprojections are inclusions and continuous because any open set in X + Y decomposes into disjoint union of subsets of X and Y which are open, and preimaging that into X gets that open set of X
    3. then if we have a continuous X+Y -> Z then continuous X->Z and Y->Z follow
    4. if we have two continuous X->Z and Y->Z, then sending X and Y to X+Y and sending that to Z elementwise is also continuous: preimage of V from Z in X+Y is a disjoint union of preimages of Z in X and Y, which are open, and so is open.
5. A promise to build an arsenal of rational continuous functions from theorems about continuity of f+g, f*g, f/g (and g≠0 anywhere)
6. Another promise: Uniform Limit Theorem, in which "uniformly" converging sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit

# Exercises
1. The other direction of epsilon delta: see above
2. If x is in Lim A, then of course f(x) is in Lim f(A), this is covered by the equivalent criterion #1
3. Let's have two topologies on the same set Let's have identity function of that set, considered as an arrow between topologies.
    1. It's continuous iff source is finer than destination
        1. ......yeah? both "identity is continuous" and "source is finer" definitionally mean "any open set in destination is open in source"
    2. it's a homeo iff domain and destination are the same topology
        1. Well, if they're both finer than each other, they're equal, duh
2. Pick arbitrary points x_0 and y_0 and map x to (x, y_0) and y to (x_0, y). these are embeddings.
    1. so not only continuous but bijective and inversion is continuous
    2. cont from X to X×Y: preimage of a basis V×W is empty if W does not contain y_0 and (open) V otherwise, done
    3. Restricting X×Y to X×y_0 restricts basis V×W to V×y_0 if y_0 in W and to empty otherwise
    4. & then there's the obvious bijection x <-> x, y_0 and V×x_0 is in fact open iff V is open
5. (a, b) of R is homeo to (0, 1) and [a, b] to [0, 1]
    1. (/ (a-b)) . (- b) is monotonous, and so is (+a) . (* (b-a)), so, yeah
2. build a function continuous at exactly 1 point
    1. which, reminder: f is cont on x if any neighbourhood V of f(x) has a neighbourhood U of x such that $f(U) \subset V$
    2. x×D(x) should work I think?
    3. maps rationals to 0 and irrationals to themselves
    3. x = 0, f(x) = 0; neighbourhoods of 0 are let's say basis intervals (a, b) containing 0
    4. their preimage is, uh, all rational numbers plus irrational numbers in that interval
    5. then (a, b) is in fact mapped into (a,b) - Q (these are mapped to 0)
    6. preimage of rationals is 0, but any interval around a nonzero rational p will map irrationals around to nonzero, which will be outside of a small neighbourhood of p in the image
    7. preimage of irrationals is x, but any interval around a nonzero irrational x will have rationals mapped to 0, which will be outside of small neighbourhood of x in the destination
8. functions continuous from the right are continuous functions from R_l to R
    1. (maybe later)
    2. Additional mayhem: what are continuous functions from R to R_l? from R_l to R_l?
3. let Y be ordered & have order topology; f,g:X->Y continuous;
    1. {x | f x =< g x} is closed in X
        1. We'll do the f x < g x is open first
        2. we want to include in an open set any x such that f(x) = a < b = g(x)
        3. We'll union over a and b of Y
        4. if we can insert c between them, we'll union $f^{-1}(-∞, c) \cap g^{-1}(c, +∞)$, otherwise these are (-∞, b) and (a, +∞)
        5. this gets us all x's that are $\exist a, b . f(x) \le a < b \le g(x)$, which is pretty much what we wanted
        6. 
    2. \x . min (f x) (g x) is continuous
        1. Pasting lemma to the rescue: f x =< g x is closed, and f and g agree on f x = g x, so we get to paste two functions continuous on closed subsets & agreeing on their intersection into a continuous function on the whole
2. (later)
3. Let's define f×g as $\lambda (x, y) . (f x, gy)$. It's continuous. (given that f and g are, yeah)
    1. By abstract nonsense. Done.
    2. *Mad laughter*
3. Let's define continuity in variables: if F: X×Y -> Z stays continuous if we restrict X to any x_0 then it's continuous in Y.
    1. F is continuous -> it's continuous in every variable.
    2. Well, let's pick a value x_0 for a variable X. {x_0} has an continuous inclusion into X, and so x_0×Y has an inclusion into X×Y, and so h:Y->Z is continuous by composition $F \circ i_{x_0}$
    3. Done
    4. (Honestly, this is "by abstract nonsense" again)
5. Show that F x y = xy / x² + y² is cont in each variable, but F x x is not (I think), and then that F itself is not
    1. x×C / x² + C² is continuous as a rational whose denominator is nonzero everywhere
    2. F x x = x²/2x² = 1/2 except @ 0 where it's 0, which is obviously not continuous
    3. And F x x is in fact a composition of F w/ the continuous diagonal function $f : X \ra X×X := x \mapsto (x, x)$
        1. (It's continuous because preimage of the basis V×W is $V \cap W$)
    2. & so F cannot be continuous; in particular, preimage of {1/2} I think must contain the line (x,x) but has a hole in 0, and so cannot be closed
        1. yes, of course; 0 will be in its closure but not itself
2. Let's have an X and subset A, and f: A -> Y, and Y Hausdorff. if f can be extended to a continuous g on Cl A, then this can be done uniquely
    1. "uniquely" here means that action of g on Bd A is somehow mandated by the fact that it's continuous and its action on A
    2. Reminder that Hausdorff spaces principally have disjoint neighbourhoods for disjoint points
    3. Let's consider the action of g on some x. How is it bound by action of g on A / continuity of g?
    1. Suppose g(x) = y. f^-1(y) was closed because {y} was, and so must be g^{-1}(y), extended by x and maybe some other points from Bd A. so: fibers of Bd A by g should be between some closed sets. 
    2. if we have y_1 and y_2, they have disjoint neighbourhoods, preimages of which should be disjoint and open. True for both f- and g-preimage. so fibers of Bd A by g should also be between open sets.
