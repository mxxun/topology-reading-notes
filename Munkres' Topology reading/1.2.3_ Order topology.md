# 1.2.3: Order topology

[toc]

## Start
1. Definition: ...it's about total orders, right. I. Kinda suspect that it might work for lattices (maybe complete lattices?) but have not thought about that enough.
    1. If yes: it'd be rather fantastic if it were possible to do a topology on the _lattice of topologies_ on X.
1. Btw, I did not guess the part about maximal/minimal elements. I guess it must make sense, though again didn't think this through yet.

1. Examples:
    1. Standrard on R
    2. Dictionary on R²
    3. Z_+; it's discrete
    4. {1,2}×Z_+, in dictionary order. Not discrete due to 2×1.

1. Rays.
    1. Open rays form a subbasis.


## Does this work for lattices?
1. No!
1. Because intersections of "open intervals" in lattices are _closed_ intervals made from meet of lower boundaries and join of upper boundaries.
    1. Well, unless meets and joins are not proper and are equal to one operand; in that case that endpoint is open.
2. However, in total orders meets and joins are guaranteed to be equal to one of operands, and so all intersections are again open intervals.
    1. Lest intersections of intervals from minimal or to maximal element, which we'll, er, elide over
