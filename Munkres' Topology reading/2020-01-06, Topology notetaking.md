1. Okay, so I actually want to go back and solve these 1.2.4 exercises, cool.
2. Let's keep progress somewhere. Here.
- [ ] Lemma 16.1: subspace-restriction of basis is basis of the subspace
- [x] Theorem 16.4: order and subspace agree on convex sets.
    - Yay!
- [ ] Exercise 1
- [x] Exercise 2
- [x] Exercise 3
- [x] A distraction! Limits. Limits are cool.
- [x] Curiosity:
    1. Topological group
        1. A set with both group and topspace, w/ inverse and group op both being continuous
    2. Locally compact group
    3. Prufer group
        1. Parametrized by p; can be described as $\langle g_1, g_2, \ldots \mid g_1^p = 1, g_2^p = g_1, \ldots \rangle$
        2. E.g. it's a subgroup of circle that only contains p^nth roots
        3. Or it's rationals w/ denominator being power of p, factored by Z
        4. Or: we can take the series of Z_p^n, somehow map each into the next, and take direct limit.
    4. Pontryagin duality
        1. Pontryagin dual of a topological group G is the group of continuous group homomorphisms from G to circle T.
        2. Pontryagin duality theorem describes a canonical isomorphism of a locally compact G to its double dual.
    3. Also: covering spaces, but that's further away re: topology
- [x] Exercise 4
- [ ] Exercise 5
- [x] Exercise 6
- [x] Exercise 7
- [x] Exercise 8
- [x] Exercise 9
- [x] Exercise 10
- [x] Theorem 17.5
- [x] Examples of closure computations
- [x] Limit points
- [x] Hausdorff spaces skim
1. And that's quite enough for today, phew.
