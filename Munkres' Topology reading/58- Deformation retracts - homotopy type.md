# 58: Deformation retracts & homotopy type

## notes
1. deformation retract(ion)! i.e. a map f:X→A that's ≃ id_X. it makes A & X homotopy equivalent for obvious reasons.
2. it induces an iso on fundamental groups for slightly less obvious but true reasons.
3. example: doubly punctured plan retracted to a figure-eight!
    1. first plane to a disk w/ 2 holes radially; then disk to 2 punctured disks joined @ at a point vertically; then punctured disks to circles radially. fun!
4. there's a technical thing about moving the basepoint that I forgot.
## exercises
1. [ ] "is deformation retract of" is transitive
    1. I think obviously by composition of retractions? or, wait, need to compose homotopies also. hm.
2. [ ] figuring out fundamental groups of specific spaces!
    1. solid torus B²×S¹: contracts to S¹, so, ℤ
    2. torus w/o a point: contracts to a figure-eight
    3. cylinder S¹×I: to S¹
    4. infinite cylinder S¹×ℝ: to S¹
    5. ℝ³ w/ nonnegative xyz axes removed! contracts to a sphere w/ 3 holes, which is a plane w/ 2, which is a figure-eight.
    6. subsets of plane:
    7. ||x|| > 1: to S¹
    8. ||x|| ≥ 1: to S¹
    9. ||x|| < 1: to a point
    10. S¹ ∪ (ℝ₊×0), circle + positive x-axis. positive axis contracts to a point in S¹.
    11. S¹ ∪ (ℝ₊×ℝ), circle + half-plane. outside contracts radially, inside horizontally, to S¹.
    12. S¹ ∪ (ℝ×0), circle + x-axis. outside contracts to poles, & that's a theta / figure-eight.
    13. ℝ²–(ℝ₊×0), plane w/o a ray. contractible.
3. [ ] homotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation.
4. [ ] homotopy-equate 8 and θ.
5. [ ] "contractible" is the same as "has homotopy type of the point".
6. [ ] retract of a contractible is contractible.
7. [ ] .....more; skip for now.
    1. though, importantly, (10) defines the winding number / degree of maps *Sⁿ* → Sⁿ, giving a glimpse of higher homotopy groups.
