# Algebraic Topology reading meta

## initial pre-structured notes
1. well we started w/ [[Munkres Topology reading meta]] and [[Hatcher's Algebraic Topology reading meta]]
2. Munkres good but it ended.
    1. ---well we didn't carefully read _all_ of it. 
3. Hatcher......nnnnnot very good though we got something from it.
4. ...well then, let's see about Rotman.

1. incidentally: http://higeom.math.msu.su/people/taras/#teaching has decent sketches for _where_ to go after Hatcher, if we manage to master it.
    1. in particular here're [[Chewing on NMU-s Panov-s Topology 2 (algebraic)]]
    2. ...panov _feels_ like it follows hatcher exactly, but it's much better segmented than Hatcher!
    3. I think I'll just do Panov on the 2nd run, and just check if Hatcher doesn't have something on top.

2. Mikhailov in his "groups and homotopy theory" lectures says:
    1. unclear how to study algtop! you can read Hatcher, but it's broad not deep.
    2. what you can do: take Neilsendorfer's Algebraic methods in unstable homotopy theory. it goes from basics all the way to the proof of James and Toda's theorem about prime exponents of unstable homotopy groups of spheres.
    3. there's a bunch to it, but you can comprehend it all, & that signifies a fairly deep & hands-on understanding of...working with topological/homotopical objects & tools.
    4. (see also at [[Mikhailov-s Groups and Homotopy Theory lectures]])

## history?
1. 2024-09-ish: read Hatcher on homology, took some notes, died at cohomology around definitions of Ext
    1. exact sequences were neat but painful (zigzag and chain homotopies...)
2. somewhere between: 
3. 2024-12-ish: 
    1. 2024-12-23-ish tried hatcher for homotopy groups, died around cellular approximations (& did not got much out of relatives etc)
    2. searched for not-Hatcher, found rotman, rotman was appealing
4. 2024-12-26-ish: chewed on Rotman
    1. %%...todo: review?%%
    2. it has an I think comprehensible approach to simplicially approximating
5. 2025-01-04: chewed some on Panov's Topology 2
    1. attempted a serious take at CW/(semi)simplicial complex definitions
    2. got to intro computations of singulars and died right before functoriality & homotopy invariance
6. 2025-01-13: structured this note (topics & degree of comfort & plans)
    1. well I wanted to review homology exact sequences by Hatcher, so like, why not.

## Various topics & our degree of study / plans about them
1. Homology....in general
    1. comfortable:
        1. definitions of simplicial & singular: sure
    2. might be good to review
        1. definition of cellular
        2. up to homotopy?
        3. computation theorems?
            1. (point's easy, direct sum of disjoint is easy)
            2. 
    1. not comfortable
        1. ~approximation theorem that establishes equivalence: yeah it's a whole shit.
        2. exact sequences & computations through them
        3. relative homology, its exact sequence, computations
        4. and excision
1. homotopy groups
    1. want:
        1. the 0s for i < n
            1. Hatcher suggests it's a cellular approximation result; we've been reading Rotman for it
        2. hurewitcz
            1. requires homology I think?
            2. might need to check it out to figure what exact homology it requires
        3. fibrations and how they're useful (→ Hopf, but maybe elsewhere also)
        4. freudental suspension
        5. how the fuck Hopf and its analogous fibrations work / come from
            1. depends on hopf probably
        6. how the fuck Serre about finiteness works
2. cohomology is presumably fruitful
    1. by reports (see in meditation's quotes) Hatcher does it even worse than the rest so like.

## meditation on alternatives to Hatcher.
1. collecting
    1. (some from math exchange, some from math discord)
    2. Fomenko & Fuchs: math discord describes it as more of a review, low-prio. (no examples? eugh.)
        1. `Fomenko Fuchs has shown me new depths for how shitty exposition can be` eugh
        2. `Read Fomenko Fuchs solely bc you will appreciate Hatcher more` no!
    3. Bredon: should be more rigorous than Hatcher, I might like it; more differential topology, which uh maybe not
        1. `I guess Bredon too but that’s also quite terse`
    4. Rotman: `people who dont like hatcher and think its vague/unrigorous like it` `so its probably pretty explicit and clear`
        1. `how about trying to use rotman and hatcher together? rotman spells out the details, while you can use hatcher for exercises and getting a fuzzy intuition about why we care about certain concepts`
    5. Dieck: off the ToC sounds maybe even denser but might be worth trying
    6. "a concise course in algebraic topology" by peter may
        1. `wow u do homotopy theory ig`
    
    7. `i think if you watch a lec series + read hatcher + do the exercises i think its golden` `like pierre albins lec series on youtube`
    8. `Apparently most AT texts after hatcher just suck` `and there is not much bridging the gap between research and hatcher` :(    
    9.  `i honestly wanna learn cohom from any another textbook i think hatcher's exposition is just so bad honestly im not even kidding`
        1. `I feel like he gets a bit less rigorous in ch3`
        2. `Or it’s just less clear`
    10. there're also lee and weibel somewhere
2. condensing
    1. ok, I think a fine order would be: try rotman, bredon / dieck
    2. Lee (intro to topological manifolds) remotely; it's old & a little off-center it feels
    3. rotman's...intro to homological algebra?
        1. ---no, intro to algebraic topology.
    4. _maybe_ may if we get into homotopy theory
3. tasting:
    1. see [[Rotman-s Algebraic Topology reading meta]] on rotman
