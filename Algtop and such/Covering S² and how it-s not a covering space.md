# Covering S² and how it's not a covering space

1. I think we've meditated on this before. anyway.

2. it's easy to comprehend sphere as a factor of a diamond; its left sides glued to right sides.
3. we can line up n or ω diamonds horizontally, _first_ glue diamonds into spheres, then glue them also horizontally (looping the left on the right or not), and that's a cover of S² by n×S².
4. well it's not a _covering space._ here's a snarl: preimages of small disks around non-poles are indeed n/ω small disks isomorphic to the image, but preimage of a small disk around the pole is instead a weird bullshit. I _think_ it's something like n disks glued at a point (at the pole).
